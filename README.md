# Official Microsoft Support Center™ (Definitely Real)

> 🏆 Submission for the **Worst UI App Competition**  
> 🎭 A satirical project designed purely for fun and awareness

## 📌 About the Project

**Official Microsoft Support Center™** is a deliberately terrible UI/UX project created as a parody of fake tech-support websites that impersonate well-known companies.

The goal of this app is **not functionality**, **not usability**, and definitely **not good design**.

The goal is:
- To make people laugh
- To highlight how obvious scam-style interfaces can be
- To raise awareness through satire

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is:
- **100% fake**
- **Not affiliated with Microsoft**
- **Not a real support service**
- **Not intended to target or insult any country or people**

It specifically mocks **online tech-support scam patterns**, not individuals or cultures.

---

## 🧠 Inspiration

Tech-support scams often share common red flags:
- Aggressive pop-ups
- Confusing layouts
- Excessive warnings
- Fake urgency
- Broken grammar
- Suspicious UI choices

Instead of writing an article about them, we asked:

> “What if we built the *worst possible UI* that looks exactly like one of these fake sites?”

And so this project was born.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Rules followed while building this app:**

- If it looks good → remove it  
- If it’s usable → break it  
- If it’s clear → make it confusing  
- If it’s accessible → ignore it  

This project intentionally violates every UI/UX best practice.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Satire & humor
- Awareness about scam UI patterns
- A fun entry for a worst-UI competition
- Educational through exaggeration

---

## 🚫 What This Is NOT

👉 **That means it’s working perfectly.**

NONE— just don’t scam anyone.
